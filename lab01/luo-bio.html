Hobbies and Interests:
Outside of school I am interested in listening to music, cooking, writing and playing videogames. My favorite musical artists are Madeon and Porter Robinson. My favorite places to listen to music are outside on walks or somewhere warm and cozy. I enjoy cooking and food photography. My interest in this comes from the joy of sharing gifts of food and art with others. I am currently studying at home with my family: my mom and my dad. My favorite video game is League of Legends, which I have been playing since 2013 and currently manage the League of Legends esports team at SU. I am looking forward to learning how to make websites for my food photography and cooking.
