            <h1>Testimonials from Parents of Students</h1>
            <p>Here are some testimonials for my tutoring service from students and parents</p>

                <h2>Alex, grade 8</h2>
                <p>My son Alex has been working with Ryan on his writing skill since 7th grade.
                    Ryan has many good ideas to work with kids. He developed a good plan to introduce Alex into
                    different writing topics and guide him through brainstorming, drafting, revising and finalizing
                    processes. He inspired Alex to think deeper and express his feelings with vivid supporting
                    details. Alex has been enjoying working with Ryan and never been hesitating to seek Ryan’s help
                    on his school writing projects or reading assignments.
                    Alex feels more comfortable writing for school on various subjects now because of Ryan's help.</p>

                        “I highly recommend Ryan as a private tutor. Ryan began to tutor my son writing a couple of month ago.
                        My son's writing improved significantly and his interest in writing increased dramatically. 
                        First all of all, Ryan can inspire kids’ interest in writing. For example, he recently reads an interesting book with my son together. 
                        Then he guides my son to write summary, prediction, comparison aor discussion. 
                        In this way, my son’s interest has been inspired significantly and he is able to write at least three essays each week, which is significant improvement. 
                        Secondly, Ryan is very good at writing and he applies his knowledge in teaching kids. After Ryan’s tutor, my son’s writing has more structure and the essay is more elegant.
                        Finally, Ryan is very patient and he encourages my son all the time. He is not only a tutor but also a good friend for my son. 
                        Our family sincerely  appreciates Ryan’s help.”
