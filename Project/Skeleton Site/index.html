                Ryan offers online one on one tutoring services through Zoom and Google Docs. As a teacher,
                Ryan is <strong>extremely patient</strong> and <strong>understanding </strong> when working with his students. He will work very
                closely with parents to develop a personalized plan to improve a student’s English work. He will
                stay in contact with parents, providing updates and insight into how their child is improving.

            <p class="p2"> A typical tutoring package will be once or twice a week, with one hour sessions each time. A
                typical session will look like this: An intro to what will be discussed or learned each week,
                followed by a review of the homework from the previous week. Finally, the week’s lesson will be
                held and homework will be assigned.
            </p>
            <p class="p3"> 
                Lessons are $25 per one hour session, with a discount package of $40 for two lessons in one
                week. Payment can be handled via check, Paypal or Venmo. The first session will be
                considered an introductory session and is free of charge. If you are interested in booking a
